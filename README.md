# Terraform ECS plan checker
Simple **Node.js** CLI tool that checks the generated **Terraform plan** for differences between the previous and new **container definitions** of an **ECS service**.

## Why
Troubleshooting a forced resource on a container definition isn't always easy and can often be something very small... Also `TF_LOG=DEBUG` is chaotic and I hate reading through it.  

I needed a simple tool that let me check the container definitions real quick to have a safe check before applying.

## Installation
```bash
npm install terraform-ecs-plan-checker -g
```

## Usage
Using the checker tool is as easy as typing `plancheck <tf-plan>`.

```json
- Grabbing the container definitions
    âˆš Grabbing successful
- Comparing the old container definitions with the new definitions
    + tf-plan | 150:       "image": "000000000.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/foo-bar:0.0.1-1"
- Differences found:  1
```

It is also possible to pass the `--clean` flag to `plancheck` to output a JSON file which enables you to process the output further.

*(eg. implementing a check to see if new image versions are available in ECR before applying the plan).*

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
IMAGES=($(plancheck tf-plan --clean |jq -r '.[] | select(.key == "image") | .value'))

for image in "${IMAGES[@]}"
do
  service=${image##*/}
  name=${service%%:*}
  version=${service##*:}
  ecr=$(aws ecr list-images --repository-name $name)

  if [[ $ecr == *"$version"* ]]; then
    echo "SUCCESS: version: '$version' exists in ECR repository '$name'"
  else
    echo "ERR: version: '$version' is not in ECR repository '$name'"
    exit 1
  fi
done
```

The problem with landscape was that it didn't take line position into account when comparing `container_definitions` and thus showed me unneeded changes making it rather hard to see what I changed.
